TI  - Long Latency and High Variability in Accuracy-Speed of Prosaccades in Alzheimer's
      Disease at Mild to Moderate Stage.
PG  - 318-29
AB  - Background: Studying saccades is a useful tool to investigate brain function.
      There is still controversy regarding deficits in prosaccades in Alzheimer's
      disease (AD), and a study of saccades in subjects with mild cognitive impairment 
      (MCI) has not been published to date. Methods: We examined horizontal saccades in
      10 healthy elderly, and 9 MCI and 9 AD patients. Two tasks were used: gap
      (fixation target extinguishes prior to target onset) and overlap (fixation stays 
      on after target onset). Eye movements were recorded with the Skalar IRIS system. 
      Results: (1) Latencies were shorter in the gap than in the overlap task (a gap
      effect) in all three groups of subjects: healthy elderly, MCI and AD; (2) for
      both tasks, latency of saccades was longer for AD patients than for healthy and
      MCI subjects, and (3) accuracy and mean velocity were normal in MCI and AD
      subjects, however, variability in accuracy-speed was higher for AD patients than 
      for healthy and MCI subjects in the overlap task. Conclusions: Abnormalities in
      reaction time and accuracy-speed variability reflect deficits in cerebral areas
      involved in the triggering and execution of saccades; a saccade test can be
      useful to follow up the evolution of MCI subjects as some of them may develop AD 
      disease.

TI  - Specific saccade deficits in patients with Alzheimer’s disease at mild to
      moderate stage and in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment.
PG  - 1287-98
AB  - Saccadic impairment in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) was found in horizontal saccades.
      The present study extends investigation to vertical saccades in a large number of
      subjects, including AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). We examined
      both horizontal and vertical saccades in 30 healthy elderly, 18 aMCI, and 25 AD. 
      Two tasks were used: gap (fixation target extinguishes prior to target onset) and
      overlap (fixation stays on after target onset). Eye movements were recorded with 
      the Eyeseecam system. (1) Robust gap effect (shorter latencies in gap than in
      overlap) exists for AD and aMCI patients as for healthy elderly; (2) abnormal
      long latency of saccades in gap and overlap tasks for AD relative to healthy
      elderly and aMCI patients; (3) longer latency for aMCI patients than for healthy 
      elderly for the overlap task; (4) significant correlation between scores of
      Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and latencies of saccades considering the AD
      group only; (5) higher coefficient of variation in latency for AD patients than
      for healthy elderly and for aMCI patients; (6) variability of accuracy and speed 
      is abnormally higher in AD patients than in aMCI and healthy elderly.
      Abnormalities of latency and latency–accuracy–speed variability reflect deficits 
      of cerebral areas involved in the triggering and execution of saccades; latency
      of saccades can be used as follow-up test for aMCI and AD patients with its
      significant correlation with the changes of MMSE scores.
